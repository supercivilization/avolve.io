**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Action:** IMMEDIATE - All team members must re-clone the repository
**Priority:** CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE
**Contact:** josh@avolve.io

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Happened

The git history for the **avolve** repository has been **permanently rewritten** to remove exposed production secrets and API keys that were accidentally committed.

**Secrets Removed:**
- YouTube API Key
- Supabase Production URL and Keys
- Other sensitive credentials

This was a **necessary security measure** to protect our production systems from potential compromise.

---

## üî¥ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### All Team Members MUST:

1. **Delete your local repository completely**
2. **Re-clone the repository from GitHub**
3. **Recreate any open pull requests**
4. **Update your environment variables**

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** Do NOT try to push from your old local copy. This will cause conflicts and potentially restore the removed secrets.

---

## üîê Security Credentials Update

### CRITICAL: Rotate Your API Keys

If you have any of these credentials, they have been **rotated**:

‚úÖ **YouTube API Key** - New key required
‚úÖ **Supabase Production URL** - May have changed
‚úÖ **Supabase Service Role Key** - Rotated for security

### Get New Credentials

1. **Contact:** josh@avolve.io for new production credentials
2. **Update:** Your local `.env.local` file with new keys
3. **Never commit:** Real credentials to git (use placeholders only)

---

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why was this necessary?

**A:** Production API keys and database credentials were accidentally committed to git history. Even though they were removed from current files, they remained accessible in git history, posing a significant security risk.

### Q: What if I just pull the latest changes?

**A:** ‚ùå **DO NOT DO THIS.** Pulling will not work correctly because the history has been rewritten. You will get merge conflicts and potentially restore the removed secrets. You MUST delete and re-clone.

### Q: Can I just run `git pull --force`?

**A:** ‚ùå **NO.** This can cause unpredictable behavior. The safest and recommended approach is to delete and re-clone.

### Q: What about my local branches and work in progress?

**A:** Save your work to patch files (see instructions above) before deleting. You can then apply the patches to the new clean repository.

### Q: Will this happen again?

**A:** We've implemented additional safeguards:
- Pre-commit hooks to detect secrets
- Updated `.gitignore` to be more comprehensive
- Template files with safe placeholders only
- Team training on secrets management

### Q: What if I already pushed from my old local copy?

**A:** Contact josh@avolve.io immediately. This is a critical security issue that needs immediate attention.

### Q: How do I know the cleanup was successful?

**A:** Run these verification commands after re-cloning:

```bash
# These should all return "No commits found" or no output
git log --all -S "AIzaSy"
git log --all -S "sb_secret"
git log --all -S "zrdkuqagtbgexphjykpy"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è New Security Practices

Going forward, **NEVER commit**:

‚ùå API keys or tokens
‚ùå Database passwords
‚ùå Service credentials
‚ùå OAuth secrets
‚ùå Private keys or certificates

**ALWAYS use:**

‚úÖ Environment variables (`.env.local`)
‚úÖ Secure credential management (Vercel secrets, etc.)
‚úÖ Placeholder values in committed files
‚úÖ `.gitignore` for sensitive files
