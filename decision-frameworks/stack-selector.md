## 🚨 Common Decision Pitfalls

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### 1. Over-Engineering for Scale
**Problem**: Choosing enterprise solutions for small projects
**Solution**: Start simple, scale when needed
```yaml
wrong_approach:
  day_1: "Microservices + Kubernetes + Message queues"
  right_approach: "Next.js + Supabase monolith"
  scale_when: "10,000+ concurrent users or $1M+ ARR"
```

#### 2. Technology FOMO
**Problem**: Adopting bleeding-edge tech in production
**Solution**: Use proven technology combinations
```yaml
production_ready: ["nextjs-15", "react-19", "supabase-stable"]
experimental: ["react-compiler", "vercel-queues", "crdt-support"]
rule: "Use stable versions for revenue-generating applications"
```

#### 3. Ignoring Team Context
**Problem**: Choosing tech stack without considering team skills
**Solution**: Match technology to team capabilities
```yaml
team_assessment:
  react_experience: "Required for Next.js"
  sql_knowledge: "Needed for Supabase"
  devops_skills: "Important for scaling"
  learning_budget: "Factor in ramp-up time"
```
