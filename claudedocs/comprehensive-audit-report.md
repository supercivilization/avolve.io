## 🔒 Security Assessment

### 🔴 Critical Security Issues (Fix Immediately)

#### 1. Hardcoded Secrets Exposure
**Location:** `/scripts/test-csv-processor.js:19-20`
```javascript
this.supabaseUrl = process.env.SUPABASE_URL || 'https://your-project-ref.supabase.co';
this.serviceKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY || 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...';
```
**Risk:** Database compromise if exposed publicly  
**Action:** Remove hardcoded fallbacks immediately

#### 2. Insecure Configuration Files
**Location:** `/supabase/.temp/pooler-url`  
**Issue:** Contains password placeholder that could be misconfigured
