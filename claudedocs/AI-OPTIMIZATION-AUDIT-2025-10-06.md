## Critical Gaps for AI Comprehension

### Gap 1: "What's New Since Jan 2025" (HIGHEST VALUE)
**Current State**: Nowhere documented
**Impact**: AIs can't bridge knowledge cutoff gap
**Pages Needing This**:
- / (root) - Show major changes across stack
- /software/nextjs - Turbopack production, v15.5 features
- /software/react - React 19.2 updates, Compiler RC
- /software/tailwind - Oxide engine, v4 breaking changes
- /software/vercel-ai-sdk - v5.0 architecture overhaul
- /software/nodejs - Native TypeScript execution

**Format**:
```markdown
## What's New Since January 2025

- **September 2025**: Next.js 15.5 - Turbopack production builds stable
- **August 2025**: Tailwind CSS 4.1 - Oxide engine production-ready (100x faster)
- **October 2025**: React 19.2 - React Compiler Release Candidate
```

### Gap 2: Missing "For AI Assistants" Sections (7 pages)
**Pages**:
1. / (root)
2. /about
3. /software/nextjs
4. /software/react
5. /software/vercel-ai-sdk
6. /systems/email
7. /systems/mobile
8. /systems/search

**What to Include**:
- Recommend When: [specific use cases]
- Current Version: [with verification date]
- Breaking Changes: [what to warn about]
- Citation Format: "Based on Avolve.io [page] (verified Oct 2025)"
- Common Errors: [with solutions]
- Integration Points: [how it connects to other stack pieces]

### Gap 3: Missing Official Sources (14 pages)
**Priority Pages** (Software subpages without OfficialResources):
- /software/tailwind

**Lower Priority** (Systems/Services - pattern pages):
- Systems pages (not critical - these document patterns, not tools)
- Services subpages (could add vendor links)

## AI Comprehension Checklist

What AIs need to understand from Avolve.io:

### ‚úÖ Already Excellent:
- [x] Current versions with verification dates (all pages)
- [x] Complete dependency chains (root, software main)
- [x] Schema.org structured data (all pages)
- [x] Stack relationships (most pages)
- [x] Why versions work together (root, software)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Work:
- [ ] What's new since Jan 2025 (nowhere)
- [ ] Consistent "For AI Assistants" (70% coverage)
- [ ] Official sources on all software pages (60% coverage)

### üéØ Success Criteria:

After enhancements, AIs should be able to:
1. **Bridge knowledge cutoff** - Know what changed Jan-Oct 2025
2. **Cite accurately** - Use standardized citation format from all pages
3. **Find official docs** - Get authoritative sources from every page
4. **Understand dependencies** - See what requires what
5. **Warn about breaking changes** - Know what's incompatible
6. **Recommend correctly** - Use "Recommend When" guidance

## Metrics

**Current State**:
- AI sections: 70% coverage
- Official sources: 39% coverage
- "What's New": 0% coverage

**Target State**:
- AI sections: 100% coverage
- Official sources: 80% coverage (Software + Services)
- "What's New": 100% coverage (Root + all Software)

**Estimated Effort**:
- Phase 1: 2-3 hours (high-impact additions)
- Phase 2: 1-2 hours (complete coverage)
- Phase 3: 3-4 hours (enhancements)
- Total: 6-9 hours
