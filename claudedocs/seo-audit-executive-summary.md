## 🔴 5 Critical Fixes (Do Today)

### 1. Create Missing Images (30 min)
**Problem:** OG image and logo don't exist
**Impact:** Broken social shares, no brand in search
**Fix:** Create `/public/og-image.png` (1200x630) and `/public/logo.png` (512x512)

### 2. Verify Google Search Console (15 min)
**Problem:** Placeholder verification code
**Impact:** No search data, can't submit sitemap, can't fix issues
**Fix:** Get real code from search.google.com/search-console, update line 62 of `/src/app/layout.tsx`

### 3. Complete Sitemap (45 min)
**Problem:** 13 pages missing from sitemap (only 7 of 20 included)
**Impact:** Google can't discover most of your content
**Fix:** Add all software/* and systems/* pages to `/src/app/sitemap.ts`

### 4. Remove Fake Rating (10 min)
**Problem:** Unverifiable "4.8/7M ratings" in schema
**Impact:** Risk of structured data penalty
**Fix:** Delete lines 54-58 in `/src/app/software/nextjs/page.tsx`

### 5. Add Canonical URLs (2 hours)
**Problem:** No explicit canonical tags
**Impact:** Duplicate content risk, diluted authority
**Fix:** Add `alternates.canonical` to metadata in all 20 pages

**Total Time: 4-6 hours**
