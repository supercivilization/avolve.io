## Market Context: The Rise of GEO/AEO (2025)

### Industry Trends

**Explosive AI Search Growth**:
- ChatGPT: **400 million weekly users** (February 2025)
- Google AI Overviews: Appear on **13.14% of all searches** (March 2025)
- Gartner prediction: **25% drop in traditional search volume by 2026**
- LLM crawler traffic **quadrupled** in 2025 (2.6% ‚Üí 10.1% of bot traffic)

**New Optimization Paradigm**:
- **SEO** (Search Engine Optimization) - Traditional Google rankings
- **AEO** (Answer Engine Optimization) - Featured snippets, knowledge panels
- **GEO** (Generative Engine Optimization) - AI-generated responses (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity)

**Triple-Threat Strategy**: Modern sites need SEO + AEO + GEO to capture full audience.

### Why This Matters for Documentation Sites

AI assistants are becoming the **primary way developers discover and learn** new technologies:

- Developer asks ChatGPT: "How do I use Next.js 15 with React 19?"
- AI searches web content, including avolve.io
- **If optimized**: AI cites avolve.io as authoritative source ‚Üí traffic spike
- **If not optimized**: AI uses competitor content ‚Üí missed opportunity

**Example Use Cases**:
- "What's the latest Next.js version?" ‚Üí AI cites your Current Stack Versions table
- "Next.js 15 + React 19 compatibility" ‚Üí AI references your integration guides
- "Modern web stack 2025" ‚Üí AI summarizes your 5S framework
