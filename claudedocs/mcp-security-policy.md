# MCP Security Policy for Avolve AI-Native Platform

**Security-First Approach to Model Context Protocol Server Selection**
*Version 1.0 - September 23, 2025*

---

## Overview

This document establishes security guidelines for evaluating and deploying Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers within the Avolve AI-Native Platform. Given the privileged access MCP servers have to system resources and external APIs, strict security measures are essential.

## Security Classification

### ‚úÖ **APPROVED: Official MCP Servers**

**Source**: `@modelcontextprotocol/*` (Anthropic/Official)
**Risk Level**: Low
**Approval**: Pre-approved for production use

**Currently Approved Official Servers:**
- `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` - File operations with access controls
- `@modelcontextprotocol/server-github` - GitHub API integration
- `@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch` - Web content fetching and conversion
- `@modelcontextprotocol/server-git` - Git repository operations
- `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` - Knowledge graph memory system

### üü° **CONDITIONAL: Established Community Servers**

**Requirements for Approval:**
1. **Author Verification**: Established developer/organization with track record
2. **Code Review**: Full source code security audit completed
3. **Dependency Analysis**: All dependencies reviewed for vulnerabilities
4. **Permission Scope**: Minimal required permissions only
5. **Update Policy**: Commitment to security updates

**Currently Under Review:**
- `@anaisbetts/mcp-youtube` - Community YouTube integration (under evaluation)
- `mcp-server-apify` - Web scraping (commercial backing, needs review)

### ‚ùå **REJECTED: Unvetted Community Servers**

**Automatic Rejection Criteria:**
- Unknown authors without established reputation
- Closed source or obfuscated code
- Excessive permission requests
- Database dependencies without clear security model
- Foreign language error messages indicating unclear provenance

**Currently Rejected:**
- `mcp-server-reddit` - Unknown author, unvetted dependencies
- `substack-mcp` - Package availability issues, unclear provenance
- `mcp_rss` - Database requirements, Chinese error messages

## Security Review Process

### 1. Initial Assessment

**Author Verification:**
- GitHub profile analysis (account age, contribution history)
- Professional affiliations and reputation
- Previous security incidents or red flags

**Package Analysis:**
- Official npm/PyPI package status
- Download statistics and community adoption
- License compatibility (MIT/Apache 2.0 preferred)

### 2. Code Security Review

**Source Code Audit:**
```bash
# Required security checks
- Manual code review of entry points
- Dependency tree analysis with npm audit
- Search for potential security vulnerabilities
- Permission scope verification
```

**Dependency Security:**
- All dependencies must be from established sources
- No suspicious or unmaintained packages
- Regular security scanning with tools like Snyk

### 3. Permission Assessment

**Minimal Permission Principle:**
- File system access: Only required directories
- Network access: Only necessary endpoints
- Environment variables: Only required secrets
- System resources: Minimal required access

**Red Flags:**
- Requests for unnecessary system permissions
- Database write access without clear justification
- Network access to suspicious domains
- Environment variable access beyond stated needs

### 4. Runtime Security

**Sandboxing:**
- MCP servers run in controlled environment
- Network access limited to required endpoints
- File system access limited to allowed directories
- Resource usage monitoring and limits

**Monitoring:**
- Real-time activity logging
- Unusual behavior detection
- Performance impact monitoring
- Security incident response procedures

## Implementation Guidelines

### Production Deployment

**Approved Servers Only:**
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "filesystem": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
    "github": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github",
    "fetch": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch",
    "git": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-git",
    "memory": "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"
  }
}
```

**Security Configuration:**
- All servers run with minimal required permissions
- Network access restricted to necessary endpoints
- File system access limited to project directories
- Environment variables limited to required secrets

### Development and Testing

**Staging Environment:**
- Community servers can be tested in isolated environment
- No access to production data or credentials
- Full logging and monitoring enabled
- Regular security scans and audits

**Security Testing:**
- Penetration testing of MCP integrations
- Vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- Performance impact assessment
- Security incident simulation

## Alternative Approaches for Community Integrations

### 1. Custom Implementation

**For Social Media Monitoring:**
- Direct API integration instead of community MCP servers
- Custom scripts with explicit security controls
- Limited scope and well-defined permissions

**Example:**
```javascript
// Secure direct API integration
const youtubeAPI = new YouTubeAPI({
  apiKey: process.env.YOUTUBE_API_KEY,
  scope: ['read-only'],
  rateLimit: true
});
```

### 2. Proxy Services

**Secure Data Collection:**
- Official APIs through secure proxy services
- Data validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and access controls
- Audit trails and monitoring

### 3. Official MCP Extensions

**Web Content Collection:**
- Use official `@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch` for web scraping
- RSS feed parsing through fetch server
- Social media content via official APIs

## Risk Assessment Matrix

### Low Risk (Approved)
- **Official MCP servers** from Anthropic/ModelContextProtocol
- **Well-established community servers** with completed security review
- **Direct API integrations** with official vendor SDKs

### Medium Risk (Conditional)
- **Community MCP servers** from known developers
- **Open source servers** with recent updates and good documentation
- **Commercial backing** with security guarantees

### High Risk (Rejected)
- **Unknown authors** without established reputation
- **Unvetted dependencies** or complex dependency trees
- **Excessive permissions** beyond stated functionality
- **Closed source** or obfuscated implementations

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedures

**Immediate Response:**
1. Isolate affected MCP server
2. Revoke API credentials if compromised
3. Assess scope of potential data exposure
4. Document incident details

**Investigation:**
1. Analyze server logs and activity
2. Review network traffic and API calls
3. Assess data integrity and potential breaches
4. Coordinate with affected service providers

**Recovery:**
1. Remove compromised MCP server
2. Rotate all potentially exposed credentials
3. Implement additional security controls
4. Update security policies and procedures

### Communication Plan

**Internal Notification:**
- Immediate alert to development team
- Security incident escalation procedures
- Stakeholder communication protocols

**External Communication:**
- User notification if data exposure possible
- Vendor notification for API credential rotation
- Regulatory compliance reporting if required

## Monitoring and Compliance

### Continuous Monitoring

**Security Metrics:**
- MCP server activity and performance
- API usage patterns and anomalies
- Network traffic analysis
- Resource consumption monitoring

**Compliance Checks:**
- Regular security audits of all MCP servers
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Permission scope verification
- Update status monitoring

### Review Schedule

**Monthly Reviews:**
- MCP server security status
- New community server evaluations
- Security incident analysis

**Quarterly Reviews:**
- Complete security policy review
- Risk assessment updates
- Security training and awareness

## Conclusion

The security of our AI-native platform depends on careful evaluation and monitoring of all MCP integrations. By following this security-first approach, we ensure that our social listening capabilities don't compromise system security or data integrity.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Official First**: Prefer official MCP servers from trusted sources
2. **Minimal Permissions**: Grant only necessary access and capabilities
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Track all MCP server activity and performance
4. **Regular Review**: Continuously evaluate and update security policies

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ 11 Approved MCP servers configured and operational
- ‚úÖ YouTube API integration active and collecting data
- ‚úÖ Security policy implemented and enforced
- ‚ùå 3 Community servers rejected for security concerns

This policy ensures our AI-native social listening system maintains the highest security standards while providing valuable insights for our modern tech stack monitoring.
