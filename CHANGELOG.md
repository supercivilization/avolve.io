## [Unreleased]

### Changed - 2025-09-30

#### Homepage Repositioning: Honest Feature Representation

**Summary:** Completely rewrote the homepage to accurately reflect operational features vs aspirational ones. The platform is now honestly positioned as "Intelligence Platform with Modern Web Stack" rather than making unverifiable claims about AI development features.

**What Changed:**

1. **Hero Section** (`apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`)
   - **Old:** "Complete AI-native development platform with 8-layer architecture"
   - **New:** "Intelligence Platform with Modern Web Stack"
   - **Old subtitle:** Claims about automatic accessibility and revolutionary workflows
   - **New subtitle:** "Real-time intelligence across 536 sources powered by 48+ production scripts"
   - Removed unverifiable performance claims (10-50x faster, 40-85% savings)
   - Added honest badges: "Intelligence: Multi-platform monitoring", "Tech Stack: Latest stable versions", "Open Source: Building in public"

2. **New Section: Live System Metrics**
   - Added real operational metrics with visual cards
   - 536 Sources Monitored (Real-time)
   - 26+ GitHub Repos Tracked (Active)
   - 48+ Working Scripts (Production)
   - Daily Data Collections (Automated)
   - Last updated timestamp: September 30, 2025

3. **Features Section: Operational vs In-Development**

   **Operational Features (with ✅ badges):**
   - 🎯 Multi-Platform Intelligence (Production Ready)
   - 📊 GitHub Ecosystem Analysis (Active)
   - 🔍 SEO & Market Research (48+ Scripts)
   - ⚡ Modern Web Stack (Latest Stack)
   - 🎨 Component Library (Ready to Use)
   - 🏗️ Monorepo Structure (Configured)

   **In-Development Features (with 🚧 badges):**
   - 🤖 AI Component Generation (Experimental)
   - 🔄 Automated Workflows (In Progress)
   - 📈 Intelligence Dashboard (Planned)
   - 🔗 API Integration Layer (In Progress)

4. **Removed Aspirational Claims:**
   - ❌ "🤖 AI Component Generation" as if it works
   - ❌ "♿ Automatic Accessibility" as automated system
   - ❌ "⚡ Performance Optimization" as AI-driven
   - ❌ "🔍 AI Code Review" as operational
   - ❌ Commands that don't exist: `pnpm ai:component`, `pnpm ai:accessibility`, `pnpm ai:optimize`, `pnpm ai:review`, `pnpm ai:init`
   - ❌ Unverifiable metrics: "10-50x faster development", "40-85% infrastructure savings", "100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance"

5. **Added Transparency Section**
   - "Building in Public" statement
   - Clear distinction: Intelligence system = Production Ready ✅
   - Clear distinction: AI dev tools = In Development 🚧
   - Honest about platform evolution

6. **Updated Getting Started Guide**
   - **Old commands:** Fake `pnpm ai:init`, `pnpm ai:component` commands
   - **New commands:** Real commands that actually work:
     - `git clone https://github.com/avolve-dao/avolve.git && cd avolve && pnpm install`
     - `cp .env.local.template .env.local`
     - `pnpm dev`
     - `pnpm social:comprehensive:test`

7. **Updated CTAs (Call to Actions)**
   - **Old:** Links to non-existent "Master Documentation Index" and "AI-Native Framework Guide"
   - **New:** Real working links:
     - 📚 Documentation Index → `/claudedocs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX_A_PLUS.md`
     - <Icons.gitBranch /> View on GitHub → `https://github.com/avolve-dao/avolve`
     - 🎯 Intelligence System → `/claudedocs/comprehensive-ai-social-listening-2025.md`

8. **Metadata Updates** (`apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`)
   - **Title:** "Avolve - Intelligence Platform with Modern Web Stack"
   - **Description:** "Real-time intelligence across 536 sources powered by 48+ production scripts"
   - **Keywords:** Added intelligence-focused terms (social listening, github monitoring, market research, seo research, competitive analysis)
   - **OpenGraph:** Updated to match honest positioning
   - **Twitter Card:** "536 sources monitored. 48+ production scripts. Built on Next.js 15.5 + React 19."

**Design Preservation:**
- ✅ Kept all Magic UI components (BlurFade, BorderBeam, Ripple, etc.)
- ✅ Maintained all animations and transitions
- ✅ Preserved accessibility features
- ✅ Kept beautiful gradient effects and modern aesthetic
- ✅ All existing styling and component quality unchanged

**Why This Change:**
- **Credibility:** Making false claims damages trust and reputation
- **SEO:** Honest content performs better long-term than aspirational marketing
- **User Experience:** Visitors find what we actually offer, not what we plan to offer
- **Team Alignment:** Development priorities clear (intelligence system works, AI tools are future work)
- **Building in Public:** Transparency is a competitive advantage

**Impact:**
- Homepage now accurately represents the platform's capabilities
- Clear differentiation between operational and in-development features
- Real metrics provide concrete value proposition
- CTAs link to actual working features and documentation
- Metadata optimized for what we actually are (intelligence platform)

**Next Pages to Update:**
Based on homepage audit, these pages likely need similar honesty updates:
- `/about` - May contain aspirational claims about the platform
- `/features` - Likely lists features as if they all work
- `/docs` or `/documentation` - May reference non-existent AI commands
- Any landing pages with feature descriptions

**Testing:**
```bash
# Verify changes locally
pnpm dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Check: All claims are accurate
# Check: All CTAs link to real pages
# Check: Design still looks beautiful
# Check: No broken links or references
```

**Related Issues:**
- Security audit completed (secrets removed from files and git history)
- Documentation needs comprehensive audit for aspirational vs reality
- Consider creating `/roadmap` page to show future plans explicitly
