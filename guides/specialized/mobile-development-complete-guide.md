# Mobile Development Tech Stack 2025: Next.js to React Native/Expo

## Expo SDK reaches maturity with SDK 54

The latest stable Expo SDK 54, released September 10, 2025, brings **iOS 26 Liquid Glass support**, precompiled React Native frameworks that reduce iOS build times by 92% (from 120s to 10s), and React Native 0.81.3 with React 19.1. The flagship Expo Router 6.0.2 now includes server components preview, API routes for full-stack development, and native liquid glass tabs on iOS/Android. SDK 54 also ships with expo-app-integrity for device verification, expo-glass-effect for native visual effects, and a stable object-oriented file system API, with 40,000+ GitHub stars and 3 million weekly npm downloads.

## React Native New Architecture becomes production standard

React Native 0.81.0 marks a watershed moment with the New Architecture enabled by default since v0.76 (October 2024), powering Meta's production apps at scale with over 2 billion daily visits. The Fabric renderer delivers synchronous UI updates with React 18 concurrent rendering, while TurboModules provides lazy loading with direct JSI communication, resulting in 75% SDK 53 project adoption. Production benchmarks from Kraken's 13M user app show 1.3x faster complete renders and 5.3x faster trading flows, with Hermes engine providing 20-30% cold start improvements and 15-25% memory reduction. Expo SDK compatibility is excellent with SDK 54 supporting RN 0.81, though third-party library compatibility remains the primary migration challenge with Firebase core libraries notably incompatible.

## NativeWind v4 revolutionizes React Native styling

NativeWind v4.1.23 achieves production readiness with full Tailwind CSS v4.1.13 support, CSS variables, experimental animations via Reanimated, and container queries optimized for mobile. The jsxImportSource transform architecture provides 40% faster refresh times compared to v2's Babel plugin approach, while lightningcss compilation significantly reduces build times. Alternative solutions show varying performance: Tamagui achieves within 10% of vanilla React Native performance with its optimizing compiler, Gluestack UI v2 combines NativeWind v4 with copy-paste components achieving 99ms renders for 1000 components, while React Native UI Lib from Wix maintains 20,999 GitHub stars with enterprise-grade production testing.

## Supabase React Native SDK tackles offline challenges

Supabase-js v2.57.4 delivers comprehensive mobile features including full real-time WebSocket support with postgres_changes and broadcast channels, OAuth deep linking with custom URL schemes, and S3-compatible storage with multipart uploads. However, native offline support remains unavailable, requiring third-party solutions like WatermelonDB integration with custom sync functions or PowerSync's enterprise WAL-based architecture. Expo SDK 53 compatibility issues stem from Node.js standard library changes requiring Metro config workarounds, while real-time reliability challenges include connection drops on mobile networks and timer throttling in background apps with no automatic message recovery.

## Nx dominates monorepo tooling for mixed projects

The monorepo landscape shows clear winners with Nx providing superior React Native/Next.js integration through @nx/react-native and @nx/expo plugins, distributed task execution across 50+ machines, and proven scalability for 26k+ component repos. Turborepo 2.5+ offers simpler setup with official React Native + Next.js starter templates, Rust-based performance delivering 40-85% build time improvements, and new features like watch mode and persistent tasks. Moon.build represents the cutting edge with WASM plugin architecture and integrated toolchain management, though early adoption limits production usage. Real-world implementations show 40-50% code reduction using React Native/Next.js monorepos with Nx chosen for complex enterprise applications and Turborepo for simpler projects.

## EAS Build emerges as deployment standard

EAS dominates the deployment landscape following Microsoft App Center's March 2025 shutdown, with recent improvements including 40% faster Android builds, pricing reductions from $200 to $50 for additional concurrency, and M4 Pro support launching March 2025. Current pricing spans from free tier (30 builds/month) to Enterprise at $1,999/month with 1000 build credits, with average build times of 8-15 minutes for Android and 15-25 minutes for iOS. Alternative solutions include Fastlane for comprehensive automation, CodePush migration to EAS Update before the March 31, 2025 deadline (with 40% pricing reduction in September 2024), and GitHub Actions offering cost-effective CI/CD at $0.28 per Android build versus EAS's $1.00.

## Zustand leads modern state management

State management benchmarks reveal Zustand 4.5.5 as the versatile winner with 46.7% usage rate, 4KB bundle size, excellent TypeScript support, and 160ms initial render times. Legend State 3.0.2 emerges as the performance champion with proxy-based reactivity achieving 140ms initial renders and 20ms updates, while Jotai 2.10.1 excels for form-heavy applications with atomic state management and 25ms complex form updates. Redux Toolkit 2.8.2 maintains enterprise dominance with 61.1% usage for complex applications requiring middleware ecosystems. MMKV revolutionizes persistence with 80% faster reads and 500% faster writes than AsyncStorage, providing synchronous API with built-in AES encryption.

## Component libraries mature with FlashList v2

Shopify's FlashList v2 eliminates estimatedItemSize requirements while achieving 50% better scrolling performance with 2+ million monthly downloads, built specifically for React Native's New Architecture. shadcn/ui CLI 3.3.1 equivalents gain traction through react-native-reusables, nativecn-ui with CLI tooling, and Gluestack UI v2's copy-paste approach bringing the namespaced registry model to React Native. React Native Skia introduces WebGPU support delivering 50% faster iOS and 200% faster Android performance with Three.js integration and TensorFlow.js compatibility. Production adoption shows React Native powering 26% of top 100 business apps with 75% of SDK 52+ projects using New Architecture.

## Development tools transform with React Native DevTools

React Native DevTools replaces Flipper as the default debugger in RN 0.76+ with browser-aligned Chrome DevTools interface, reliable breakpoints, integrated React component inspection, and zero configuration setup. Expo Dev Client 6.0.12 enables custom development builds with any native libraries, EAS Update integration for preview deployments, and enhanced launcher UI for switching between servers. Commercial solutions emerge with Radon IDE from Software Mansion offering VSCode/Cursor extension at $19-29/month featuring in-editor simulators, click-to-jump-to-code, and AI assistant trained on React Native. TypeScript configurations emphasize strict mode with @react-native/typescript-config base, monorepo project references, and consistent path aliasing across packages.

## Production readiness and adoption metrics

The ecosystem shows remarkable maturity with React Native weekly downloads increasing from 2.28M to 3.57M+, Expo SDK 54 achieving 40,000+ GitHub stars, and major enterprises including Meta, Microsoft, Shopify, and Tesla in production. Performance improvements are substantial: iOS builds 92% faster with precompiled frameworks, New Architecture delivering 5.3x faster renders in production apps, and Hermes engine providing 2-3x startup improvements. Developer experience advances through 15x faster Metro resolver performance, automatic New Architecture enablement, and comprehensive debugging tools replacing deprecated solutions.

## Conclusion

The 2025 React Native/Expo ecosystem represents a mature, production-ready platform for extending Next.js applications to mobile. Key decisions include adopting Expo SDK 54 with New Architecture enabled by default, choosing between NativeWind v4 for utility-first styling or Tamagui for performance-critical applications, implementing Nx for complex monorepos or Turborepo for simpler setups, migrating from CodePush to EAS Update before the March 2025 deadline, and selecting Zustand for versatile state management or Legend State for maximum performance. The combination of these tools, along with FlashList v2 for lists and React Native Skia for graphics, provides a robust foundation for building high-performance cross-platform applications that share significant code with Next.js web applications while maintaining native performance characteristics.
