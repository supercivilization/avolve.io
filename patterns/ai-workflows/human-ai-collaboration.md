## Tool-Specific Workflow Patterns (The Avolve AI Trifecta)

While the above principles are tool-agnostic, our team employs a specific, multi-tool strategy to maximize efficiency. We leverage the distinct strengths of Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex in a "Trifecta" model.

### The Simple Decision Framework

- **Use Gemini CLI for: Daily Development & Analysis**
  - **One-line rule:** *Start here for everything - it's free and handles 90% of tasks well.*
  - Your default for everyday coding, UI components, documentation, and large-scale codebase analysis.

- **Use Claude Code for: Production Code & Architecture**
  - **One-line rule:** *If it's going to production or affects your architecture, use Claude.*
  - Used for final code reviews, complex architectural decisions, and security-critical logic.

- **Use Codex for: Speed & Experimentation**
  - **One-line rule:** *When you need speed over perfection or want to explore multiple approaches.*
  - Used for rapid prototyping, generating multiple variations, and long-running autonomous tasks.

**For a complete breakdown of this strategy, including task-specific recommendations for our stack, see the [AI Coding Assistant Decision Framework](../../decision-frameworks/ai-assistant-decision-framework.md).**
